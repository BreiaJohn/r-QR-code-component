### What I learned

What I learned in this coding coding challenge was how to style my code with CSS. Even though I have experience with CSS my goal is to continue to sharpen and improve my code so that I can be more confident in my CSS.

```html
<h1>Improve your front-end skills by building projects</h1>
```

```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: var(--light-gray);
}
```

If you want more help with writing markdown, we'd recommend checking out [The Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/) to learn more.

### Continued development

I feel I am in a decent place as far as CSS is concerned, however I am not yet where I'd like to be. My goal is to continue working on projects to strengthen my CSS skills.

### Useful resources
